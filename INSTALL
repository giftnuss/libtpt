UNIX
----
If you have multiple C++ compilers, it is a good idea to specify which C++
compiler should be used for building LibTPT.

The configure.pl script reads the CXX environment variable or you can use the
"--cxx" option to specify where the C++ compiler is.

E.g.

> ./configure.pl --cxx=/usr/local/bin/g++32

or

> CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++32 ./configure

Run configure.pl to for a default configuration (use --help for more options).

For a default build:

> ./configure.pl
> make
> cd test
> ./test.sh
> cd ..
> make install

WINDOWS
-------
LibTPT currently supports Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, and is known to work with
Visual C++.Net (7.0).  For best performance, it is highly recommended that you
install the STLPort (http://www.stlport.org/).

By default, the Microsoft projects for TPT are configured for Multithreaded
libraries.  You may experience link errors if linking with Singl-threaded
libraries unless you change this setting.

Load w32/tptlib.dsw
Build test1
From command line,

> cd <libtpt directory>
> cd test/
> test.bat

There is no automatic install for Windows.  Copy libtpt_static.lib from the
lib/ directory and inc/libtpt/*.h to the desired location.
