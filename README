LibTPT is a C++ library for a template scripting language.  The
difference between LibTPT and other scripting languages is that LibTPT
is designed specifically to rely on C++ for I/O, making it easier to
port, smaller, and faster.  In the course of normal execution, the C++
program will populate a symbols table using highspeed machine code, then
the TPT parser will convert a template to text output, passing the
text back to the C++ programs high speed I/O system.

TPT is currently used for CGI output and source code generation, but can
also be used in the creation of MUDs, interactive tutorials, or just
about any task that requires the generation customized text.
